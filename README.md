Data Science / Research Portfolio (Jekyll scaffold)
--------------------------------------------------

This folder is a minimal Jekyll-compatible scaffold for a research/data-science portfolio.
It is designed to be dropped into a repository named: yourusername.github.io and served via GitHub Pages.

How to use:
1. Rename the repository on GitHub to: yourusername.github.io
2. Replace site variables in _config.yml (email, url)
3. Add your profile picture to: assets/images/profile.jpg (replace the placeholder)
4. Edit the markdown files under _pages/ and data under _data/ to add your content.
5. Commit and push to the main branch. GitHub Pages will build the site automatically.

Structure:
- _config.yml            (site config)
- _layouts/              (basic HTML layouts)
- _includes/             (header & footer)
- _pages/                (about, projects, publications, talks, capacity, community, cv)
- _data/                 (projects, publications, talks, capacity - YAML lists)
- assets/css/styles.css  (site styles)
- assets/images/profile.png  (placeholder profile image)
