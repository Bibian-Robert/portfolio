    <h1>Hi, I’m Bibian N. Robert</h1>
    <p>I am a geospatial research scientist with deep experience in data science, health systems research, and geospatial analytics applied to global health challenges. My work integrates spatial modeling, statistical analysis, data visualization, and evidence synthesis to support maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health (MNCAH) initiatives across Kenya and Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

    <p>My research spans routine health data quality assessment, geographical accessibility modeling, climate–health interactions, diagnostic landscapes, and geospatial inequality analyses. I have contributed to peer-reviewed publications, policy-oriented health profiles, global health guidelines, and multi-stakeholder national reports.</p>

    <p>Beyond research, I am passionate about <strong>capacity building, mentorship, and community outreach</strong>. I serve as an AccessMod Regional Trainer for Eastern & Southern Africa and have led multiple GIS and data science training programs at institutional and regional levels.</p>
